Looker ecommerce data analysis

This is an analysis of TheLooker's sales with python in order to maximize the sales.
I might build a dashboard as well later once the exploratory data analysis is done.

The data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is available in the `analysis.ipynb` file.

As we are talking now, we are in the data cleaning phase of the project.
